- Iâ€™m a Data Analytics Engineering graduate student at George Mason University, where I turn complex problems into exciting opportunities.
- Armed with a passion for innovation and a knack for critical thinking, I bring a fresh perspective to every project. Whether it's leading teams to unlock hidden insights or embracing the power of data to drive change, I thrive on tackling challenges head-on.
- My expertise spans Machine Learning, Data Science, and Generative AIâ€”fields where Iâ€™m constantly pushing the boundaries to transform abstract ideas into tangible, game-changing solutions. For me, data isnâ€™t just numbers; itâ€™s a story waiting to be told, and Iâ€™m here to helpÂ writeÂ it.
